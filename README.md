# COMP6206-Eulerian-Video-Magnification
Vision Based Blood Pressure/Pulse Detection

To reproduce the results shown in the paper:
1) (Optional) Run "make.m" to build pyramid toolbox libraries (this is 
REQUIRED if using Mac OS and MATLAB newer than 2011b).
2) Run "install.m".
3) Run "reproduceResults.m" to reproduce all the results in the paper.


Current issues:
Uses pyramid toolbox (matlabPyrTools) - requires "make.m" to build library
Uses MATLAB's Image Processing Toolbox
What does 'install.m' do?
